## Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Good | Needs Work | Poor |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| INP (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | ≤ 500ms | > 500ms |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.25 | > 0.25 |

## TTFB Diagnosis

When TTFB is slow (> 800ms), check each component in DevTools Network waterfall:

- [ ] **DNS resolution** slow → add `<link rel="dns-prefetch">` or `<link rel="preconnect">` for known origins
- [ ] **TCP/TLS handshake** slow → enable HTTP/2, consider edge deployment, verify keep-alive
- [ ] **Server processing** slow → profile backend, check slow queries, add caching

## Frontend Checklist

### Images
- [ ] Images use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- [ ] Images are responsively sized (`srcset` and `sizes`)
- [ ] Images and `<source>` elements have explicit `width` and `height` (prevents CLS in art direction)
- [ ] Below-the-fold images use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`
- [ ] Hero/LCP images use `fetchpriority="high"` and no lazy loading

#### Responsive image example

Apply the image checklist above to the measured LCP/image bottleneck.

```html
<!-- BAD: No dimensions, no format optimization -->
<img src="/hero.jpg" />

<!-- GOOD: Hero / LCP image — art direction + resolution switching, high priority -->
<!--
  Two techniques combined:
  - Art direction (media): different crop/composition per breakpoint
  - Resolution switching (srcset + sizes): right file size per screen density
-->
<picture>
  <!-- Mobile: portrait crop (8:10) -->
  <source
    media="(max-width: 767px)"
    srcset="/hero-mobile-400.avif 400w, /hero-mobile-800.avif 800w"
    sizes="100vw"
    width="800"
    height="1000"
    type="image/avif"
  />
  <source
    media="(max-width: 767px)"
    srcset="/hero-mobile-400.webp 400w, /hero-mobile-800.webp 800w"
    sizes="100vw"
    width="800"
    height="1000"
    type="image/webp"
  />
  <!-- Desktop: landscape crop (2:1) -->
  <source
    srcset="/hero-800.avif 800w, /hero-1200.avif 1200w, /hero-1600.avif 1600w"
    sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"
    width="1200"
    height="600"
    type="image/avif"
  />
  <source
    srcset="/hero-800.webp 800w, /hero-1200.webp 1200w, /hero-1600.webp 1600w"
    sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"
    width="1200"
    height="600"
    type="image/webp"
  />
  <img
    src="/hero-desktop.jpg"
    width="1200"
    height="600"
    fetchpriority="high"
    alt="Hero image description"
  />
</picture>

<!-- GOOD: Below-the-fold image — lazy loaded + async decoding -->
<img
  src="/content.webp"
  width="800"
  height="400"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
  alt="Content image description"
/>
```

### JavaScript
- [ ] Bundle size under 200KB gzipped (initial load)
- [ ] Code splitting with dynamic `import()` for routes and heavy features
- [ ] Tree shaking enabled (verify dependency ships ESM and marks `sideEffects: false`)
- [ ] No blocking JavaScript in `<head>` (use `defer` or `async`)
- [ ] Heavy computation offloaded to Web Workers (if applicable)
- [ ] `React.memo()` on expensive components that re-render with same props
- [ ] `useMemo()` / `useCallback()` only where profiling shows benefit
- [ ] Long tasks (> 50ms) broken up to keep the main thread available — main lever for INP
- [ ] `yieldToMain` pattern used inside long-running loops so input events can run between chunks
- [ ] Modern scheduling APIs used where available: `scheduler.yield()` (preferred), `scheduler.postTask()` with priorities, `isInputPending()` to yield only when needed
- [ ] `requestIdleCallback` for deferrable, non-urgent work (analytics flush, prefetch, warmup)
- [ ] Non-critical work deferred out of event handlers (e.g. analytics, logging) so the response to the interaction is not delayed
- [ ] Third-party scripts loaded with `async` / `defer`, audited for size, and fronted by a facade when heavy (chat widgets, embeds)

#### React render example

Use profiling to establish an expensive render or calculation before adding memoization.

```tsx
// BAD: Creates new object on every render, causing children to re-render
function TaskList() {
  return <TaskFilters options={{ sortBy: 'date', order: 'desc' }} />;
}

// GOOD: Stable reference
const DEFAULT_OPTIONS = { sortBy: 'date', order: 'desc' } as const;
function TaskList() {
  return <TaskFilters options={DEFAULT_OPTIONS} />;
}

// Use React.memo for expensive components
const TaskItem = React.memo(function TaskItem({ task }: Props) {
  return <div>{/* expensive render */}</div>;
});

// Use useMemo for expensive computations
function TaskStats({ tasks }: Props) {
  const stats = useMemo(() => calculateStats(tasks), [tasks]);
  return <div>{stats.completed} / {stats.total}</div>;
}
```

#### Bundle splitting example

Use the bundle analysis to choose heavy, rarely-used features or routes; retain appropriate loading states.

```typescript
// Modern bundlers (Vite, webpack 5+) handle named imports with tree-shaking automatically,
// provided the dependency ships ESM and is marked `sideEffects: false` in package.json.
// Profile before changing import styles — the real gains come from splitting and lazy loading.

// GOOD: Dynamic import for heavy, rarely-used features
const ChartLibrary = lazy(() => import('./ChartLibrary'));

// GOOD: Route-level code splitting wrapped in Suspense
const SettingsPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/Settings'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
      <SettingsPage />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### CSS
- [ ] Critical CSS inlined or preloaded
- [ ] No render-blocking CSS for non-critical styles
- [ ] No CSS-in-JS runtime cost in production (use extraction)

### Fonts
- [ ] Limited to 2–3 font families, 2–3 weights each (every additional weight is another request)
- [ ] WOFF2 format only (smallest, universal support — skip WOFF/TTF/EOT)
- [ ] Self-hosted when possible (third-party font CDNs add DNS + TCP + TLS round-trips)
- [ ] LCP-critical fonts preloaded: `<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>`
- [ ] `font-display: swap` (or `optional` for non-critical) to avoid FOIT blocking render
- [ ] Subsetted via `unicode-range` to ship only the glyphs each page needs
- [ ] Variable fonts considered when multiple weights/styles are required (one file replaces many)
- [ ] Fallback font metrics adjusted with `size-adjust`, `ascent-override`, `descent-override` to reduce CLS on font swap
- [ ] System font stack considered before any custom font

### Network
- [ ] Static assets cached with long `max-age` + content hashing
- [ ] API responses cached where appropriate (`Cache-Control`)
- [ ] HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 enabled
- [ ] Resources preconnected (`<link rel="preconnect">`) for known origins
- [ ] `fetchpriority` used on critical non-image resources (e.g., key `<link rel="preload">`, above-the-fold `<script>`) — not only on `<img>`
- [ ] No unnecessary redirects

### Rendering
- [ ] No layout thrashing (forced synchronous layouts)
- [ ] Animations use `transform` and `opacity` (GPU-accelerated)
- [ ] Long lists use virtualization (e.g., `react-window`)
- [ ] No unnecessary full-page re-renders
- [ ] Off-screen sections use `content-visibility: auto` with `contain-intrinsic-size` to skip layout/paint of non-visible areas
- [ ] No `unload` event handlers and no `Cache-Control: no-store` on HTML responses — preserves back/forward cache (bfcache) eligibility

## Backend Checklist

### Database
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns (use eager loading / joins)
- [ ] Queries have appropriate indexes
- [ ] List endpoints paginated (never `SELECT * FROM table`)
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Slow query logging enabled

#### N+1 query example

Use this when query evidence shows repeated related-record lookups.

```typescript
// BAD: N+1 — one query per task for the owner
const tasks = await db.tasks.findMany();
for (const task of tasks) {
  task.owner = await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id: task.ownerId } });
}

// GOOD: Single query with join/include
const tasks = await db.tasks.findMany({
  include: { owner: true },
});
```

#### Paginated query example

Adapt bounds and ordering to the project's accepted pagination contract.

```typescript
// BAD: Fetching all records
const allTasks = await db.tasks.findMany();

// GOOD: Paginated with limits
const tasks = await db.tasks.findMany({
  take: 20,
  skip: (page - 1) * 20,
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
});
```

#### Query plans
- [ ] The database-specific plan command and output semantics are understood
- [ ] `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is used only for representative reads in an authorized, bounded environment; mutating statements require an isolated disposable environment and explicit authorization
- [ ] A plan is captured **before** the fix, not just after — it is the baseline
- [ ] `Seq Scan` on a large table understood: index missing, unusable, or genuinely not worth it
- [ ] Estimated vs actual `rows=` within an order of magnitude (if not, refresh statistics before touching indexes)
- [ ] No `Sort` node that a composite index could absorb
- [ ] Plan re-checked after the change — an index that did not improve the plan gets reverted

#### Query plan example

This is PostgreSQL-style syntax. Apply [query-plan safety](#query-plans): `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` executes the statement, so use an authorized, bounded representative read; mutating statements require the documented isolated environment and explicit authorization.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, title FROM tasks
WHERE owner_id = 42 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
```

#### Index strategy
- [ ] Composite index column order is equality first, then range/sort
- [ ] Index covers the query shape (filter + sort), not just one column in isolation
- [ ] Covering index considered for hot read paths (index-only scan avoids the heap fetch)
- [ ] Not indexing low-selectivity columns *for the dominant value*; a partial index still serves the rare-value query (`WHERE status = 'failed'`)
- [ ] Expression index used where the query applies a function (`lower(email)`)
- [ ] Full-text or trigram index used for leading-wildcard search, not a B-tree
- [ ] Write cost measured on write-heavy tables (every index taxes every `INSERT`/`UPDATE`)
- [ ] Candidate unused or duplicate indexes checked for constraints, replicas, and a representative observation window before removal through a reviewed, reversible migration

#### Index example

Use a before/after plan and the [index strategy](#index-strategy) to justify this shape; consider write cost and revert an index that does not improve the plan.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_owner_created ON tasks (owner_id, created_at DESC);
```

#### Connection pooling
- [ ] One pool reused per database/connection configuration in each process, not per request or call site
- [ ] Combined application pool capacity stays below the database's `max_connections` with operational headroom
- [ ] Acquisition timeout set so exhaustion fails fast instead of queueing forever
- [ ] Exhaustion diagnosed before resizing: find what holds connections (long transactions, missing `await`, leaked clients) and check database saturation
- [ ] Serverless or autoscaling uses an appropriate multiplexing proxy when direct pools cannot preserve the connection budget

#### Pool reuse example

Apply the [connection pooling checklist](#connection-pooling) first. These capacity/timeouts are examples; size combined instances below the database ceiling with headroom.

```typescript
// BAD: a pool per request or call site — under serverless this multiplies
// by instance count and exhausts the database's connection limit
// GOOD: reuse one pool per database/connection configuration in each process
const pool = new Pool({
  max: 10,                        // total app pools must leave database headroom
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30_000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 5_000, // fail fast instead of queueing forever
});
```

### API
- [ ] Response times < 200ms (p95)
- [ ] No synchronous heavy computation in request handlers
- [ ] Bulk operations instead of loops of individual calls
- [ ] Response compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Appropriate caching (in-memory, Redis, CDN)

### Infrastructure
- [ ] CDN for static assets
- [ ] Server located close to users (or edge deployment)
- [ ] Horizontal scaling configured (if needed)
- [ ] Health check endpoint for load balancer

## Caching Strategies

The decision material (which layer, which invalidation strategy, what never to cache) lives in the `performance-optimization` skill. This section covers the read/write patterns and the checklist.

### Cache implementation example

Apply the Skill's layer/key/staleness decisions and [cache checklist](#cache-checklist) before adapting these snippets. The TTL is illustrative; `public` responses must be identical for every authorized viewer represented by the key.

```typescript
// Cache frequently-read, rarely-changed data
const CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
let cachedConfig: AppConfig | null = null;
let cacheExpiry = 0;

async function getAppConfig(): Promise<AppConfig> {
  if (cachedConfig && Date.now() < cacheExpiry) {
    return cachedConfig;
  }
  cachedConfig = await db.config.findFirst();
  cacheExpiry = Date.now() + CACHE_TTL;
  return cachedConfig;
}

// HTTP caching headers for static assets
app.use('/static', express.static('public', {
  maxAge: '1y',           // Cache for 1 year
  immutable: true,        // Never revalidate (use content hashing in filenames)
}));

// Cache-Control only for public API responses that are identical for this key
// Never mark personalized or authorization-dependent responses as public
res.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=300'); // 5 minutes
```

### Read and write patterns

| Pattern | How it works | Use when | Watch out for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cache-aside** (lazy) | App checks cache, on miss reads origin and populates | Default choice; read-heavy, tolerant of a cold first hit | Every miss hits the origin, so it needs stampede protection |
| **Read-through** | Cache layer itself loads on miss | You want the load path in one place, not at every call site | Hides origin latency; a slow origin looks like a slow cache |
| **Write-through** | Write goes to cache and origin synchronously | Read-after-write freshness is required and partial failures are handled | Ordering and dual-write failure mean this alone does not guarantee strong consistency |
| **Write-behind** (write-back) | Write hits cache, origin updated asynchronously | Write-heavy, and the origin is the bottleneck | Data loss window if the cache dies before the flush. Needs durability you can defend |

### Negative caching

Cache the *absence* of a result too. A key that misses on every lookup (a nonexistent user ID probed in a loop, a 404 asset) sends every request to the origin, which is a cache that only protects the happy path.

- Store an explicit "not found" sentinel with a **shorter** TTL than positive entries
- Keep the negative TTL short enough that a newly created record appears promptly
- Never let an origin *error* become a negative cache entry, or one failing minute becomes many

### Request coalescing (stampede protection)

One recompute, N waiters. This in-process sketch assumes each key namespace has one result type and one fetch policy:

```typescript
const inFlight = new Map<string, Promise<unknown>>();

function loadOnce<T>(key: string, fetcher: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  const existing = inFlight.get(key) as Promise<T> | undefined;
  if (existing) return existing;
  const p = fetcher().finally(() => inFlight.delete(key));
  inFlight.set(key, p);
  return p;
}
```

For a shared cache, the same idea needs a distributed lock with bounded ownership semantics, or `stale-while-revalidate` so waiters serve the stale value instead of blocking.

### Cache checklist
- [ ] The cached call was measured as expensive first (caching a fast call adds a hop and buys nothing)
- [ ] Read/write ratio justifies the cache (re-read far more often than written)
- [ ] Cache key includes every input the response varies on: tenant, viewer, locale, permissions, feature flags
- [ ] No per-user data cached under a key that does not identify the user
- [ ] `public` response caching is limited to content that is identical for every authorized viewer represented by the key
- [ ] A primary invalidation strategy is stated; any combined strategies have explicit ordering and correctness boundaries
- [ ] Acceptable staleness window written down, not implied by whatever TTL was typed
- [ ] Stampede protection on hot keys (coalescing, lock, or `stale-while-revalidate`)
- [ ] Negative results cached with a shorter TTL; origin errors never cached
- [ ] Eviction policy and memory ceiling set (an unbounded cache is a memory leak)
- [ ] Hit rate monitored — a cache nobody measures is an assumption, and a low hit rate is pure overhead
- [ ] Nothing cached whose staleness is a correctness bug (balances, permissions, inventory at checkout)

## Measurement Commands

### INP field data and DevTools workflow

1. **Field evidence when available and authorized** — check [CrUX Vis](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/vis) or an existing RUM tool for real-user INP. Without it, use controlled local measurements and leave production user impact unverified; do not install telemetry merely to finish local work.
2. **Identify slow interactions** — open DevTools → Performance panel → record while interacting; look for long tasks triggered by clicks/keystrokes
3. **Test on mid-range Android** — INP issues often only surface on slower hardware; use a real device or DevTools CPU throttling (4×–6× slowdown)

```bash
# Lighthouse CLI
npx lighthouse https://localhost:3000 --output json --output-path ./report.json

# Bundle analysis
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer stats.json
# or for Vite:
npx vite-bundle-visualizer

# Check bundle size
npx bundlesize

# Web Vitals in code
import { onLCP, onINP, onCLS } from 'web-vitals';
onLCP(console.log);
onINP(console.log);
onCLS(console.log);

# INP with interaction-level detail (attribution build)
import { onINP } from 'web-vitals/attribution';
onINP(({ value, attribution }) => {
  const { interactionTarget, inputDelay, processingDuration, presentationDelay } = attribution;
  console.log({ value, interactionTarget, inputDelay, processingDuration, presentationDelay });
});
```

### Backend measurement example

Use the project's existing timing/APM/query tooling to isolate the measured backend path.

```bash
# Response time logging
# Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
# Database query logging with timing

# Simple timing
console.time('db-query');
const result = await db.query(...);
console.timeEnd('db-query');
```

### CI measurement examples

Use existing project dependencies and authorized CI checks; these commands do not require installing tools or expanding CI.

```bash
# Bundle size check
npx bundlesize --config bundlesize.config.json

# Lighthouse CI
npx lhci autorun
```

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| N+1 queries | Linear DB load growth | Use joins, includes, or batch loading |
| Unbounded queries | Memory exhaustion, timeouts | Always paginate, add LIMIT |
| Missing indexes | Slow reads as data grows | Add indexes for filtered/sorted columns |
| Indexing without reading the plan | Write cost paid, read gain unproven | Capture the plan before and after; revert if it does not improve |
| Redundant or unused indexes | Every write pays for them | Verify dependencies and representative usage, then remove through a reversible migration |
| Connection pool per request | Exhausts `max_connections` under load | Reuse per database configuration, retain headroom, and proxy when needed |
| Cache key missing the viewer | One user's data served to another | Key on tenant, viewer, locale, permissions |
| Unbounded cache | Memory leak wearing an optimization's clothing | Set eviction policy and a memory ceiling |
| Cache stampede on a hot key | Origin takes full concurrent load at expiry | Coalesce misses, or `stale-while-revalidate` |
| Layout thrashing | Jank, dropped frames | Batch DOM reads, then batch writes |
| Unoptimized images | Slow LCP, wasted bandwidth | Use WebP, responsive sizes, lazy load |
| Large bundles | Slow Time to Interactive | Code split, tree shake, audit deps |
| Blocking main thread | Poor INP, unresponsive UI | Chunk long tasks with `scheduler.yield()` / `yieldToMain`, offload to Web Workers |
| Memory leaks | Growing memory, eventual crash | Clean up listeners, intervals, refs |
