# Spec-Driven Development

## Overview

Define unclear requirements before dependent implementation. Reuse an existing specification or a sufficiently concrete user request as the source of truth for scope and acceptance. Write only the specification detail needed to resolve the actual gaps.

## When to Use

- Defining a new project or feature whose desired behavior is not yet concrete
- Missing requirements would materially change scope or success criteria
- A request bundles independently testable capabilities that need a shared contract

**When NOT to use:** Single-line fixes, typo corrections, or changes where requirements are unambiguous and self-contained.

## Workflow and Acceptance

Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement, with a capability scope check only when needed. Reuse existing requirements and acceptance instead of restarting completed phases. A planning-only request authorizes the specification and plan, not implementation. For an implementation request, proceed through ordinary preparation within the accepted scope; do not require a separate human approval at each phase.

Ask when a missing decision materially affects the outcome and cannot be resolved from project evidence or delegated judgment. Continue independent work while waiting. For changes that may materially alter ownership, dependencies, contracts, or migration boundaries, hand off to `modular-architecture-design`. Preserve its single selected route, `ARCHITECTURE_GATE` / `DISCOVERY` no-write boundary, and documented exit condition; a spec or general delegation does not bypass them.

### Phase 0: Scope Check

Most requests describe one capability. If this one does, skip this phase and go straight to Specify — Phase 0 exists for the exception, not the rule, and it puts no hierarchy on single-capability features.

**Detection.** Decompose before specifying when a single requirement bundles several independently testable capabilities:

- The requirement names distinct capabilities with their own consumers or data (e.g. identity, billing, notifications, reporting)
- Acceptance criteria cluster into groups that could ship and be verified separately
- One capability could be cut or replaced without rewriting the others' requirements

**Propose a capability map before writing any spec.** Small and reviewable — a module table plus a build order, not a project plan:

```markdown
# Capability Map: [Initiative Name]

| Module id | Responsibility | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| identity | Accounts, sessions, SSO | — |
| billing | Plans, invoices, payments | identity |
| notifications | Email and webhook fan-out | identity |
| reporting | Usage dashboards | billing, notifications |

Build order: identity → billing, notifications → reporting
```

- **Stable module ids.** Kebab-case, chosen once, never renamed mid-initiative. Specs, plans, and downstream commands select work by these ids instead of guessing which spec is active.
- **Dependency direction, no cycles.** Arrows point one way. If two modules each need the other, they are one module.
- **Interfaces live at the boundary.** The map records that `billing` depends on `identity`; the contract between them belongs in the provider module's spec (see `api-and-interface-design` for designing it).

Validate the map against existing ownership and accepted boundaries. Seek acceptance for a material unresolved boundary decision through the architecture owner; an already accepted map does not need another approval before writing module specs.

**Then work per capability.** Use dependency order and scope each spec to its objective, boundaries, and success criteria. Use the project's canonical spec location; otherwise keep the map and needed specs under `.codex/`. Reuse an existing authoritative document and preserve other tasks' incomplete work.

### Phase 1: Specify

Start from the user's requested outcome and available evidence. Ask only for missing information that could materially change the result; state reasonable assumptions for reversible details and continue.

**Surface assumptions immediately.** Before writing any spec content, list what you're assuming:

```
ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:
1. This is a web application (not native mobile)
2. Authentication uses session-based cookies (not JWT)
3. The database is PostgreSQL (based on existing Prisma schema)
4. We're targeting modern browsers only (no IE11)
→ Correct me now or I'll proceed with these.
```

Don't silently fill in ambiguous requirements. The spec's entire purpose is to surface misunderstandings *before* code gets written — assumptions are the most dangerous form of misunderstanding.

**Write a spec document covering these six core areas:**

1. **Objective** — What are we building and why? Who is the user? What does success look like?

2. **Commands** — Full executable commands with flags, not just tool names.
   ```
   Build: npm run build
   Test: npm test -- --coverage
   Lint: npm run lint --fix
   Dev: npm run dev
   ```

3. **Project Structure** — Where source code lives, where tests go, where docs belong.
   ```
   src/           → Application source code
   src/components → React components
   src/lib        → Shared utilities
   tests/         → Unit and integration tests
   e2e/           → End-to-end tests
   docs/          → Documentation
   ```

4. **Code Style** — One real code snippet showing your style beats three paragraphs describing it. Include naming conventions, formatting rules, and examples of good output.

5. **Testing Strategy** — What framework, where tests live, coverage expectations, which test levels for which concerns.

6. **Boundaries** — Record applicable project requirements, existing authorization, and material unresolved decisions. A schema, dependency, or CI file is not by itself a reason to ask again. Preserve explicit architecture gates, destructive-action boundaries, and the prohibition on weakening checks merely to pass.

**Spec template:**

```markdown
# Spec: [Project/Feature Name]

## Objective
[What we're building and why. User stories or acceptance criteria.]

## Tech Stack
[Framework, language, key dependencies with versions]

## Commands
[Build, test, lint, dev — full commands]

## Project Structure
[Directory layout with descriptions]

## Code Style
[Example snippet + key conventions]

## Testing Strategy
[Framework, test locations, coverage requirements, test levels]

## Boundaries
- Always: [...]
- Ask first: [...]
- Never: [...]

## Success Criteria
[How we'll know this is done — specific, testable conditions]

## Open Questions
[Anything unresolved that needs human input]
```

**Reframe instructions as success criteria.** When receiving vague requirements, translate them into concrete conditions:

```
REQUIREMENT: "Make the dashboard faster"

REFRAMED SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Dashboard LCP < 2.5s on 4G connection
- Initial data load completes in < 500ms
- No layout shift during load (CLS < 0.1)
→ Are these the right targets?
```

This lets you loop, retry, and problem-solve toward a clear goal rather than guessing what "faster" means.

### Phase 2: Plan

With the validated spec, generate a technical implementation plan:

1. Identify the major components and their dependencies
2. Determine the implementation order (what must be built first)
3. Note risks and mitigation strategies
4. Identify what can be built in parallel vs. what must be sequential
5. Define verification checkpoints between phases

> Follow `planning-and-task-breakdown` for the dependency-graph mapping and vertical-slicing mechanics behind these steps; it is the canonical source. The bullets above are a lightweight summary; if they ever diverge, `planning-and-task-breakdown` takes precedence.
>
> **Output convention:** Use the canonical plan and task list targets defined by `planning-and-task-breakdown`, including its protection for existing incomplete plans. Project-designated locations take precedence over defaults.

The plan should be reviewable: the human should be able to read it and say "yes, that's the right approach" or "no, change X."

### Phase 3: Tasks

Break the plan into discrete, implementable tasks:

- Each task should be completable in a single focused session
- Each task has explicit acceptance criteria
- Each task includes a verification step (test, build, manual check)
- Tasks are ordered by dependency, not by perceived importance
- Split by independent outcomes, uncertainty, and verification boundaries rather than a file-count limit

> Follow `planning-and-task-breakdown` for the full task-sizing and dependency-ordering mechanics; it is the canonical source. The template below is a lightweight inline form; if they ever diverge, `planning-and-task-breakdown` takes precedence.

**Task template:**
```markdown
- [ ] Task: [Description]
  - Acceptance: [What must be true when done]
  - Verify: [How to confirm — test command, build, manual check]
  - Files: [Which files will be touched]
```

### Phase 4: Implement

Continue authorized implementation using incremental delivery when complexity warrants it and meaningful tests for affected behavior. Load focused spec sections and source files. Do not turn the related Skills into a mandatory lifecycle for every task.

## Keeping the Spec Alive

The spec is a living document, not a one-time artifact:

- **Update when decisions change** — If you discover the data model needs to change, update the spec first, then implement.
- **Update when scope changes** — Features added or cut should be reflected in the spec.
- **Commit the spec** — The spec belongs in version control alongside the code.
- **Reference the spec in PRs** — Link back to the spec section that each PR implements.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is simple, I don't need a spec" | Simple tasks don't need *long* specs, but they still need acceptance criteria. A two-line spec is fine. |
| "I'll write the spec after I code it" | That's documentation, not specification. The spec's value is in forcing clarity *before* code. |
| "The spec will slow us down" | A 15-minute spec prevents hours of rework. Waterfall in 15 minutes beats debugging in 15 hours. |
| "Requirements will change anyway" | That's why the spec is a living document. An outdated spec is still better than no spec. |
| "The user knows what they want" | Even clear requests have implicit assumptions. The spec surfaces those assumptions. |
| "It's one big feature; splitting it is overhead" | If acceptance criteria cluster into independently testable groups, a monolithic spec forces every downstream task to reason over the whole contract. A ten-line capability map is the cheap alternative. |
| "I'll decompose during planning" | Planning slices tasks within a spec. By then the oversized artifact already exists — module boundaries and dependency direction must be decided before the spec is written, not after. |

## Red Flags

- Starting to write code without any written requirements
- Asking "should I just start building?" before clarifying what "done" means
- Implementing features not mentioned in any spec or task list
- Making architectural decisions without documenting them
- Skipping the spec because "it's obvious what to build"
- One spec whose requirements span several independently testable capabilities
- Material module boundaries changed without satisfying the architecture owner's exit condition

## Verification

Before proceeding to implementation, confirm:

- [ ] The spec covers all six core areas
- [ ] Material unresolved decisions are accepted; prior acceptance for the same scope is preserved
- [ ] Success criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Boundaries (Always/Ask First/Never) are defined
- [ ] The spec is saved to a file in the repository
- [ ] Bundled capabilities have a coherent map and any required architecture acceptance
- [ ] Each module spec traces to the canonical map, when one is needed
